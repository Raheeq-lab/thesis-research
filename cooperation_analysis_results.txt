COOPERATION ANALYSIS RESULTS
=========================
Analysis Date: 2024
Dataset: Merged Urban and Rural Dataset

OVERVIEW
--------
This analysis examined differences in cooperation between urban and rural schools
using two measures: Social Motives Cooperation and Well-being Cooperation.

1. SOCIAL MOTIVES COOPERATION
----------------------------
Sample Information:
* Urban: n = 1,195 students
* Rural: n = 502 students
* Total: N = 1,697 students

Descriptive Statistics:
* Urban Schools:
  - Mean = 0.056
  - Standard Deviation = 0.676

* Rural Schools:
  - Mean = 0.092
  - Standard Deviation = 0.912

Statistical Results:
* Independent samples t-test: t(1695) = -0.810
* p-value = 0.4184 (not significant)
* Effect size: Cohen's d = -0.049 (negligible effect)

Key Finding:
No statistically significant difference in social motives cooperation 
between urban and rural students. The slightly higher scores in rural 
schools were not meaningful (negligible effect size).

2. WELL-BEING COOPERATION
------------------------
Sample Information:
* Urban: n = 1,195 students
* Rural: n = 502 students
* Total: N = 1,697 students

Descriptive Statistics:
* Urban Schools:
  - Mean = 0.052
  - Standard Deviation = 0.975

* Rural Schools:
  - Mean = -0.055
  - Standard Deviation = 1.006

Statistical Results:
* Independent samples t-test: t(1695) = 2.036
* p-value = 0.0420 (significant at p < 0.05)
* Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.110 (negligible effect)

Key Finding:
While there was a statistically significant difference favoring urban
schools, the effect size was negligible, suggesting minimal practical
difference in well-being cooperation between settings.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
------------------
1. Both cooperation measures showed very small differences between
   urban and rural settings.

2. Social Motives Cooperation:
   - No significant difference
   - Slightly higher in rural schools (not meaningful)
   - More variability in rural scores

3. Well-being Cooperation:
   - Statistically significant but negligible difference
   - Slightly higher in urban schools
   - Similar variability in both settings

4. Practical Implications:
   - Cooperation skills appear to be similarly developed across
     both urban and rural educational settings
   - Location (urban vs. rural) does not appear to substantially
     impact students' cooperation abilities

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
------------------
- Analysis used independent samples t-tests (unequal variances)
- Effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d
- Missing data was handled through listwise deletion
- All statistical assumptions were checked and met
